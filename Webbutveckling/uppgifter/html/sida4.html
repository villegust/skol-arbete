        They wishin' on me, yuh
        I been movin' calm, don't start no trouble with me
        Tryna keep it peaceful is a struggle for me
        Don't pull up at 6 AM to cuddle with me
        You know how I like it when you lovin' on me
        I don't wanna die for them to miss me
        Yes I see the things that they wishin' on me
        Hope I got some brothers that outlive me
        They gon' tell the story, shit was different with me
        God's plan, God's plan
        I hold back, sometimes I won't, yuh
        I feel good, sometimes I don't, ayy, don't
        I finessed down Weston Road, ayy, 'nessed
        Might go down a G-O-D, yeah, wait
        I go hard on Southside G, yuh, Way
        I make sure that north side eat
        And still
        Bad things
        It's a lot of bad things
        That they wishin' and wishin' and wishin' and wishin'
        They wishin' on me
        Bad things
        It's a lot of bad things
        That they wishin' and wishin' and wishin' and wishin'
        They wishin' on me
        Yuh, ayy, ayy (ayy)
        She say, "Do you love me?" I tell her, "Only partly"
        I only love my bed and my momma, I'm sorry
        Fifty Dub, I even got it tatted on me
        81, they'll bring the crashers to the party
        And you know me
        Turn a O-2 into the O-3, dog
        Without 40, Oli', there'd be no me
        'Magine if I never met the broskis
        God's plan, God's plan
        I can't do this on my own, ayy, no, ayy
        Someone watchin' this shit close, yep, close
        I've been me since Scarlett Road, ayy, road, ayy
        Might go down as G-O-D, yeah, wait
        I go hard on Southside G, ayy, Way
        I make sure that north side eat, yuh
        And still
        Bad things
        It's a lot of bad things
        That they wishin' and wishin' and wishin' and wishin'
        They wishin' on me
        Yeah, yeah
        Bad things
        It's a lot of bad things
        That they wishin' and wishin' and wishin' and wishin'
        They wishin' on me
        Yeah
